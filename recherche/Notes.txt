Atmospheric model is tweaked to achieve 0.2 kg/m^3 density at ground

Note the artifact of slow speed increase(!) around second 9. Artifact due to singularity in atmospheric model

Ignore hypersonic flight
Ignore produced lift

Chute opens instantaneously

terminal velocity after chute approaches real speed really closely

height needed to cancel out speed: ~776m + 25% safety zone = 970

parachutes land with 3.5 - 5 m/s downward speed : 5 m/s = upper boundary for landing speed
