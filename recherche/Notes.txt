Atmospheric model is tweaked to achieve 0.2 kg/m^3 density at ground

Note the artifact of slow speed increase(!) around second 9. Artifact due to singularity in atmospheric model

Ignore hypersonic flight


Chute opens instantaneously

terminal velocity after chute approaches real speed really closely

thruster have somewhat"realistic" behaviour

Landing Speeds
-------------------
parachutes land with 3.5 - 5 m/s downward speed : 5 m/s = upper boundary for landing speed
nasa approximates .75 m/s for EDL/MSL sky crane (Way et al. 2006)

rotation assumed to be perfect => inverse normalized speed (Ignore produced lift :()


"Death Zone"
-------------------
determined "death zone" experimentally:
height needed to cancel out 150 m/s with oerfect orientation: ~1666 m (experimentally)
fun fact: NASA set their start range to 1500 - 2000! and ~100m/s (Way et al. (2006))
linearization (working point) at half: 862.5

observation:
delta in height causes non-linear difference for y of extreme point:
correct, because dead + ramp up time for thrusters proportion increases non-linearly for whole time => distance is time of non-slowed descent * speed

had doubts about model correctness, but model is correct:
canceling out speed in low delta height is (practically) constant.

Fuel Consumptions
-------------------
Is estimated with a powered descent time of 3 min
390kg / 3 * 60s = 2,16 kg/s at full throttle

Model Instability
-------------------
Simulation resolution greatly impacts results.
had errors with overflows/masked zero crossings. Extremely slow with fixed time.

What seems to help:
discrete-time controller as opposed to continuous seems to help
controller setup! Don't feed controller with extreme values from other regions (in this case height) and switch output.
Instead, switch controller input to zero in uninteresting regions. Controller output will be 0.


Angle Test Range
-------------------
Theoretically acceptable angles: -25 to -10 Â° Wells (2006) respectively -14 to -15.5 (Edquist et al. (2009))

Mach Speeds
-------------------
Mach Speed calculated after formula (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach-Zahl)
k and Rs approximated (see Mars Atmosphere Gas Constant.ods)
T is according to Atmosphere Model (https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/atmosmrm.html)
