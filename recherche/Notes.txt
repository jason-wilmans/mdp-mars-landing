Atmospheric model is tweaked to achieve 0.2 kg/m^3 density at ground

Note the artifact of slow speed increase(!) around second 9. Artifact due to singularity in atmospheric model

Ignore hypersonic flight


Chute opens instantaneously

terminal velocity after chute approaches real speed really closely


Landing Speeds
-------------------
parachutes land with 3.5 - 5 m/s downward speed : 5 m/s = upper boundary for landing speed
nasa approximates .75 m/s for EDL/MSL sky crane (Way et al. 2006)

rotation assumed to be perfect => inverse normalized speed (Ignore produced lift :()


"Death Zone"
-------------------
determined "death zone" experimentally:
height needed to cancel out speed: ~1380 m + 25% safety zone = 1725
fun fact: NASA set their start range to 1500 - 2000! and ~100m/s (Way et al. 2006)
linearization (working point) at half: 862.5

observation:
delta in height causes non-linear difference for y of extreme point:
correct, because dead + ramp up time for thrusters proportion increases non-linearly for whole time => distance is time of non-slowed descent * speed

had doubts about model correctness, but model is correct:
canceling out speed in low delta height is (practically) constant.

Observation: simulation resolution greatly impacts results

Fuel Consumptions
-------------------
Is estimated with a powered descent time of 5 min
390kg / 5 * 60s = 1.3 kg/s at full throttle
