@article{Blanchard1980,
abstract = {Results of an investigation to determine the full scale drag coefficient in the high speed, low density regime of the Viking lander capsule 1 entry vehicle are presented. The principal flight data used in the study were from onboard pressure, mass spectrometer, and accelerometer instrumentation. The hypersonic continuum flow drag coefficient was unambiguously obtained from pressure and accelerometer data; the free molecule flow drag coefficient was indirectly estimated from accelerometer and mass spectrometer data; the slip flow drag coefficient variation was obtained from an appropriate scaling of existing experimental sphere data. Comparison of the flight derived drag hypersonic continuum flow regime except for Reynolds numbers from 1000 to 100,000, for which an unaccountable difference between flight and ground test data of about 8{\%} existed. The flight derived drag coefficients in the free molecule flow regime were considerably larger than those previously calculated with classical theory. The general character of the previously determined temperature profile was not changed appreciably by the results of this investigation; however, a slightly more symmetrical temperature variation at the highest altitudes was obtained.},

abstract = {Aerothermodynamic design environments are presented for the Mars Science Labora- tory entry capsule backshell and parachute cone. The design conditions are based on Navier-Stokes ow eld simulations on shallow (maximum total heat load) and steep (maxi- mum heat ux) design entry trajectories from a 2009 launch. Transient interference e ects from reaction control system thruster plumes were included in the design environments when necessary. The limiting backshell design heating conditions of 6.3 W=cm2 for heat ux and 377 J=cm2 for total heat load are not in uenced by thruster rings. Similarly, the thrusters do not a ect the parachute cover lid design environments (13 W=cm2 and 499 J=cm2). If thruster jet rings occur near peak dynamic pressure, they will augment the design environments at the interface between the backshell and parachute cone (7 W=cm2 and 174 J=cm2). Localized heat uxes are higher near the thruster fairing during jet rings, but these areas did not require additional thermal protection material. Finally, heating bump factors were developed for antenna radomes on the parachute cone.},

@article{Haberle1993,
abstract = {A 1D boundary-layer model of Mars based on a momentum equation that describes friction, pressure gradient, and Coriolis forces is presented. Frictional forces and convective heating are computed using the level-2 turbulence closure theory of Mellor and Yamada (1974). The model takes into account the radiative effects of CO2 gas and suspended dust particles. Both radiation and convection depend on surface temperatures which are computed from a surface heat budget. Model predictions are compared with available observations from Viking landers. It is concluded that, in general, the model reproduces the basic features of the temperature data. The agreement is particularly good at entry time for the V L-2 site, where the model and observations are within several degrees at all levels for which data are available.},

@article{Way2007,
abstract = {In 2010, the Mars science laboratory (MSL) mission will pioneer the next generation of robotic entry, descent, and landing (EDL) systems by delivering the largest and most capable rover to date to the surface of Mars. In addition to landing more mass than prior missions to Mars, MSL will offer access to regions of Mars that have been previously unreachable. The MSL EDL sequence is a result of a more stringent requirement set than any of its predecessors. Notable among these requirements is landing a 900 kg rover in a landing ellipse much smaller than that of any previous Mars lander. In meeting these requirements, MSL is extending the limits of the EDL technologies qualified by the Mars viking, Mars pathfinder, and Mars exploration rover missions. Thus, there are many design challenges that must be solved for the mission to be successful. Several pieces of the EDL design are technological firsts, such as guided entry and precision landing on another planet, as well as the entire sky crane maneuver. This paper discusses the MSL EDL architecture and discusses some of the challenges faced in delivering an unprecedented rover payload to the surface of Mars.},
